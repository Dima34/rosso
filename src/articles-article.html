						Metal boxes are a sliding system that includes roller guides. Looks like a construction of a pair of stamped metal walls of the box. At the top are the rollers themselves together with a pair of guides.
						The metal thickness does not exceed 1.2 mm. The color range is limited to white and metal. Most often metaboxes can be found in the kitchen. However, they are also suitable for other furniture, where there are retractable lockers. The most popular are metaboxes with a partial extension system. But furniture with full extension of lockers also exists. True, the cost
						<br><br>
						To assemble such a drawer is quite simple. It is necessary to pierce the bottom, facade and its back wall. Usually the first and the last is done from the LDSP. It is not necessary to adjust the facade to the design of the product. The fastening system allows you to adjust the facade in relation to the furniture body.

						<p class="body-1">Calculate the size of the boxes is simple. To do this, you need to remember several points:
							<br><br>
							- The bottom of the LDPS corresponds to the side walls minus 2 mm.. 
							- Width = inner shell size, with 32 mm to be subtracted.. 
							- Rear wall of FDSP = bottom width.. 
							- Rear wall height of FDSP = side wall height less 16 mm.
							<br><br>	
							You can calculate and independently. To do this, you need to apply not only formulas, but also special programs. They can be found on the official website of the selected furniture manufacturer. For example, on the page of the largest company Blum there is a program DYNAPLAN.

							Before you choose any retractable furniture, you need to pay attention to some parameters. They include:
							<br><br>
							- Size and Size;. 
							- Guide element;. 
							- Optional options;. 
							- Make and manufacturer.
							<br><br>
							The boxes can also include railings that increase the height of the side walls. Accordingly, the box will be larger and roomy. It can also include a smooth closure system. This allows you to close without hitting the frame. Thus, the furniture will get less damage and will last longer.
							<br><br>
							A separator can be built into the drawer. It allows you to store small items. Each section has a specific item. So it will be difficult to lose it. Such systems are most often used in the kitchen to separate the devices: forks, spoons, legs. And in the bedroom to separate socks, ties and other clothes.
							<br><br>
							If the buyer is not particularly aware of the choice of the extendable system, it can always consult with the seller. He will talk about the types of boxes and help to choose the necessary.
